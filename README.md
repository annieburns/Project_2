# Project_2

##Project MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
There seems to be a social network for everything these days, whether its sharing your favorite movies, photos or songs.  There also seems to be apps such as Yelp or Google (Places) that allow people to search restaurants, museums, galleries -- you name it.  

When your relatives or a friend comes to town, the first thing they ask is where should I go?  There seems to be a lack of an easily accessible and sharable app in which you simply track your favorite places (restaurants, bars, markets etc.) in one simple library in which you can easily share.  I have met several people that have a list saved somewhere on their computer that they send out when that dredded question ('where should i go?') is asked.  Plot is a simple CRUD app that categorizes your favorite spots by category and allows you to easily share that list with whomever.  Think of it as your own personal Time Out nyc that you can easily share with others.

So next time when someone asks... "what should I do, where do you recommend?" You simple send them your Plot so they can see:

*Restaurants
*Bars
*Galleries
*Museums
*Events
*Stores
*Hidden Gems (Other)


This Beta version will be unique to NYC and Brooklyn.  With further development, it will incorporate other APIs so that saved favorites ('Plots') will also show the Yelp review and google information about it, giving the reader a full idea of this place on one page.  In addition, with further development, the categories and subcategories will grow as well as the social sharing components so that Plot can be shared via Facebook, Instagram and more.
